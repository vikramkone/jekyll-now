Welcome to my site. A lil about me first: 

I currently work as an Engineering Manager at Facebook.
Previously I worked as software engineer at Microsoft. 
I was born in Andhra Pradesh, India and lived there for 2 decades before moving to the United States to pursue Masters at NC State in Computer Networking.
After finishing graduate studies, I moved to Seattle, Washington and have been living here since 2008.

I love the pacific northwest but hate the rain!
Other than work, I like hiking, Visiting new places, Driving, Cooking, Sushi, Movies, Music, Reading Fiction etc.
I have a twin brother, Vinod, who lives in California and an elder sister, Vandana who lives in Hyderabad, India.
I'm married to a wonderful girl, Upasana
